# Sea Level Riser App #
Version 1.0 of an interactive [ShinyApp](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/index.html) map using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) showing sea level rise around the world. Data set is a large raster file from ESRI of altitudes. The data were already aggregated, so resolution is still coarse.

Areas are colored purely from altitude, so there are some internal land areas that are unlikely to be flooded.
